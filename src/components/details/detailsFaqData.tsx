      <span>
        The exhibition is scheduled to start in May-June 2025. We need to allow enough time, preferebly 1 month prior to exhibition launch, to allow artists and ourselves prepare all artworks and let the world know we're coming. We will finalise exact dates and will announce them directly to each artist and across all our channels as soon as they're confirmed. All participating artists will receive advance notice before the public announcement.

        At present all artists sales will be correlated and made at the end of each month. We have built an online invoicing system to make it easier for you to send an invoice to us. It will auto generate all artworks & prints you have sold for the past 30 days, so all you need to do is 'click send'. Take a look in the Artist Dashboard (click on the profile icon top right), then navigate to the 'Analytics' tab, and the 'Generate Invoice' is the big green button at the bottom.<br /><br />We are working on automatic split payments, so when your work sells, you get your $$$ instantly. This is a little while off yet. But. It is coming, and you will be the first to use it!

    content: <span><strong className="font-bold">WE TAKE CARE OF IT ALL, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO!</strong> This is all pretty simple for us, as we've spent over a decade helping 1000's of artists around Australia, and the world with all of the above. We understand that dealing with a full-time or part-time job, as well as trying create new artworks (or even just catch up with fam), and then you spend half the day running around to sort out some fresh print/art sales, all to rock up at a post office that just closed. Add salt ... then you miss the 86 tram home and shit just gets wild from here on. Let us deal with it (Not the Tram, that's on you), otherwise, we got you. </span>

        Not everyone can make it to our IRL space, and that's why we're taking it to the world with your very own <strong className="font-bold">247.art KICK-ASS online sales profile!</strong><br /><br />
        Each artist will receive their own custom domain, think of it as a 'Link in BIO' but with direct sales right at your collectors fingertips, and not just a bland few hyperlinks floating on the page.<br /><br />
        We call it the artist <strong className="font-bold">ATLAS</strong>, an acronym for Artist BIO, Techniques/Styles, Links, Artworks & Social media. A searchable artist "encyclopedia" (do they even exist anymore?) all in one place!<br /><br />
        On top of that, we'll add a fully immersive 3D lidar scan of the exhibition! Peep the Virtual Tour on our About Us page.<br /><br />
