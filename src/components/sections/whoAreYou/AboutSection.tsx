            Over the past decade, we've proudly dedicated ourselves to supporting artists and their creative journeys through our work at galleries and studios we've built such as Lanes End, VS. Gallery (with the inimitable Ben Frost & Nixi Killick), Milkbar, and most recently, OSHI our current location, and, future home of 247, on the always vibing Smith St, Collingwood.
          </p>
          <p className="text-black text-xl font-bold">
            Each of these spaces has been a labor of love, designed to foster connections between artists, collectors, and the wider community.

            In addition to our gallery work, our artist printing services have been a cornerstone of our efforts to empower artists. By providing high-quality printing in fine art (GiclÃ©e), apparel, merchandise, and more, we've helped countless artists generate passive income and expand their creative practices into new avenues.
