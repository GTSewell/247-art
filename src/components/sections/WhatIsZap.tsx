            We are GT Sewell and Jane Rolls, long-time advocates for Melbourne's vibrant arts community. You may have met us galivanting around at artist studios, like Everfresh or Blender, or, maybe at a kick-ass exhibition at Backwoods or B-side, or, maybe you're more along the lines of "Who TF are they!?"  ... well,
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-black font-medium">
            Over the past decade, we've proudly dedicated ourselves to supporting artists and their creative journeys through our work at galleries and studios we built like Lanes End, VS. Gallery (with the inimitable Ben Frost & Nixi Killick), Milkbar, and most recently, OSHI our current location on the always vibing Smith St, Collingwood.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-black font-medium">
            Each of these spaces has been a labor of love, designed to foster connections between artists, collectors, and the wider community.

          <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-black font-medium">
            In addition to our gallery work, our artist printing services have been a cornerstone of our efforts to empower artists. By providing high-quality printing in fine art (GiclÃ©e), apparel, merchandise, and more, we've helped countless artists generate passive income and expand their creative practices into new avenues.
          </p>

            We've also helped build amazing creative activations around Australia, including{' '}
